allergen_rules.py

Deterministic compliance rules engine for NZ/AU Food Standards Code
Standard 1.2.3 (Information requirements - warning statements, advisory
statements and declarations) - the "PEAL" (Plain English Allergen
Labelling) mandatory declarable allergens.

This module is intentionally self-contained (no external knowledge base /
RAG lookup) per project scope - it is used as a second, deterministic
verification pass on top of whatever the Bedrock LLM extracts, so the
final "Contains ..." tags shown to a diner are never based on the LLM's
judgement alone.

The mapping is a starting point for a demo/prototype and should be
reviewed by a food-safety qualified person before being relied on in a
real commercial setting - it is not exhaustive of every product name,
regional ingredient, or brand-specific formulation.
